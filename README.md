 #4 I Can Fight those Ninjas

         Create an if statement that
         prints the string 'That's too
         many!'

         If the variable ninjas
         contains a number that's less
         than 50, prints: 'it will be a
         struggle, but I can take em.'

         If it's less than 30, and
         prints 'I can fight these
         ninjas!' if it's less than
         10.

            Ninjas = 5

4.  Label another variable **ninjas** under the initial.
5.  Set this variable to **greater than or equal to 100**.

            Ninjas <= 100

6.  Add below:

        Print(‘’’That’s too many!’’’)
